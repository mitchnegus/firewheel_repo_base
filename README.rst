This Model Component repository contains many of the basic objects necessary to create an experiment using FIREWHEEL.
This includes initializing the experiment graph, creating the basic VM object, and converting the graph to minimega commands to launch the experiment.
Because the Model Components contained within this repository are relied upon by almost every other repository, it is necessary to have this repository installed.
